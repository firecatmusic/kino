# Car Lights
Tab with headlights, hazard lights and neon/underglow.

**`SYNC LIGHTS`** button toggles the light synchronization. This only affect whether or not you will see other players enabling/disabling their lights. Color and and brightness are always synchronized between players with the mod.  

**`ENABLE LIGHTS`** enables the headlights on your car. Pretty self explanatory.  

**`HAZARD LIGHTS`** enables the hazards. They are pre-configured for all the cars, but you can change their position to better fit the bodykit. You can adjust how quick they blink as well.  

**`NEON`** underglow. The dream of every ricer. Pre-configured for all the cars.  

**`CONFIGURE`** buttons open the window where you can adjust the lighting features.
